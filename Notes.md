# Python


the basis is [ThinkPython 3rd Edition](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)

We need to work out how these get submitted, maybe the right way is via Github Gists

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## The Notebooks, Symphony No. 1 in Python Major; Op. 5.2

These notesbook are the chapters of the book, with some modifications to make them work in Google Colab.
Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.
We should be able to run the code examples in these notebooks. If not, we'll have to quickly figure out a way to make them work.

And we will also be talking in depth about list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, set comprehensions, and generator expressions.
(because, ProTip: they'll be asked by interviewers)
